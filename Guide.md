## Before You Begin (What you'll need)

To get started, you'll need a V2Ray server configuration from your provider. The easiest way to do this is with a **subscription URL** (that long link they give you).

Most clients will let you just paste that URL in, and you're good to go! You can also usually add servers by scanning a **QR code**. ✅

## Android — Modern & Powerful: NekoBox 🐈

[Get NekoBox for Android](https://github.com/MatsuriDayo/NekoBoxForAndroid)

**Why NekoBox?** It's built on sing-box, meaning it supports a bunch of newer, faster protocols beyond just V2Ray. If your provider offers things like Hysteria2 or TUIC, this is the client for you!

**Super-simple steps:**
1.  Install the APK from the GitHub releases link.
2.  Open the app → go to the `Profiles` tab → tap the `+` button.
3.  Choose `Add profile from URL` and paste in your subscription link.
4.  Tap on your new profile group to fetch all the servers.
5.  Head over to the `Dashboard` tab, pick a server you like, and hit the big connect button at the bottom! ▶️

## Android — Simple & Solid: V2RayNG 👍

**Super-simple steps:**
1.  Install the APK from the GitHub releases page.
2.  Pop open the app → tap the `+` button → choose **Import config from URL**.
3.  Paste your subscription link and let it load the servers.
4.  Select a server from the list → tap the big 'V' icon on the bottom right to connect.
5.  Check your new IP on a site like `whatismyipaddress.com` to make sure it's working!

**Pro-tip:** If something fails, check the app log (in the side menu). It'll usually tell you what's wrong, like a typo in your UUID.

## Stuck? Quick Troubleshooting Checklist 🤔

-   **❌ Wrong credentials?** Double-check your UUID, port, and protocol match what your provider gave you.
-   **🌐 Transport mismatch?** If the server uses WebSocket (`ws`), make sure your client is also set to `ws`.
-   **🔒 TLS issues?** Try toggling TLS on/off. It has to match the server's setting.
-   **📜 Check the logs!** The client's log is your best friend. It will almost always tell you why a connection is failing.
